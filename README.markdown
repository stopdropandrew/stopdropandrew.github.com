Andrew Grim's Blog
==================

This is the Jekyll source for Andrew Grim's blog.

It was based off of the awesome Scott Chacon and Michael Bleigh's blog and website, I just find/replaced everything.

It makes some nice use of Jekyll's liquid templating system (see blog.html) and uses Javscript to pull information from GitHub for the open-source section.
